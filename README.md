This project explores the question: Can debiasing methods that incorporate audio and genre features outperform generic debiasing approaches in balancing relevance and fairness?

Recommender systems in music (e.g., Spotify, Last.fm) are often criticized for popularity bias, where algorithms disproportionately promote mainstream tracks at the expense of long-tail or emerging artists. This harms diversity, limits user discovery, and can reinforce market inequalities. While prior research has proposed generic debiasing methods such as re-ranking and inverse propensity scoring, these approaches frequently treat all unpopular tracks as equal, leading to recommendations that are less musically relevant.

This project aims to evaluate whether content-aware debiasing—methods that use music-specific features such as audio descriptors (e.g., tempo, energy, danceability)—can mitigate popularity bias while maintaining musical coherence with users' previous interaction history. The expectation is to produce a comparative analysis of generic versus content-aware debiasing, demonstrating the trade-offs between fairness, accuracy, and musical coherence in music recommendation.
